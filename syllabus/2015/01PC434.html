1.	JAPAN’S ODA ~ Framework and recent trend ~  (by M. Yokokawa)<br />
The history of Japan’s ODA started in 1954 as war reparations to Burma (Myanmar).  Since then, it has long functioned as a key instrument of Japan’s foreign policy.  This year, 2014, is a milestone in the history of Japan’s ODA - it marks the 60th anniversary of its start.  Throughout its long history, any significant change in the international or domestic environment inevitably has entailed the renewal or adjustment of Japan’s ODA policy.  In particular, in recent years, we can see more dynamic movements in ODA than ever before (such as PPP, Strong Partnership with Private Sector, Huge Projects financed by Yen Loan).<br />
At the beginning of this session, a general picture of Japan’s ODA scheme will be given.  This is followed by the brief overview of new trends of Japan’s ODA.  At the end of this session, the role of Consultant in ODA programs will be briefly described in order to encourage your understanding of the following sessions.<br />
  <br />
2.	URBAN PLANNING PROJECTS (by K. Yamada)<br />
About half of the world population live in urban areas.  While the urban area provides site for production and services, it also houses poverty.  Urban planning is a tool for managing and regulating the urban growth based on the future visions shared by the citizens and an urban master plan.  The urban planning also provides for conservation of greenery, water area, historical heritages, and others.  Effective urban planning will be the key for controlling of development, conservation of environment in developing nations and triggering sustainable economic growth.<br />
Urban planning has been one of the target areas in Japan’s ODA to the developing countries.  The lecturer has conducted a number of these urban planning projects under Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) program, including Astana (Kazakhstan), Cairo (Egypt), Bangkok (Thailand), Vientiane (Laos) and Nairobi (Kenya). In this presentation the essence of effective urban planning methodologies and participatory process will be focused.<br />
There will also be a group work with an imaginative urban development situation involving a few player groups with different interests, such as entrepreneurs, an NGO working for poverty alleviation, and a local government in charge of urban planning. This group work will provoke insights into a coordination process in an urban planning situation that involves different way of thinking.<br />
<br />
3.	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJECTS (by K. Asano)<br />
From a wide range of environmental concerns, Japan’s ODA White Paper of 2013 discusses four key environmental issues; climate change, environmental pollution, “Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD)” and biodiversity conservation. This session will focus on biodiversity conservation in the context of Japan’s ODA. In developing countries, large part of poor population is dependent on their surrounding natural resources for their means of living. Thus, conservation of biodiversity should be achieved not only by regulating development activities, but promoting sustainable resource use with the participation of rural population. A recent trend in biodiversity conservation project became to have two-fold objective; biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation.<br />
In this session, a brief overview will be given on the current status, issues and trends on the biodiversity conservation projects in the world. A case study will be given from a JICA’s technical cooperation project in Brazil to deepen understanding on challenges in actual project implementation. “Jalapao Region Ecological Corridor Project”: Brazil’s Cerrado biome (tropical savanna) possesses the world richest biodiversity among all semi-arid ecosystems. The project aims at promoting ecosystem connectivity by introducing “ecological corridors” through enhancing local conservation governance and also integrating various actions in different government institutions. <br />
<br />
4.	WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECTS (by S. Misaki)<br />
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which was adopted in the UN Millennium Summit in 2000, declared that the international society would cooperatively make efforts to halve the proportion of the population without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015.  Subsequently various activities have been strenuously executed by international cooperation agencies and advanced countries’ governments, and Japan has been one of the major players in such a global movement.<br />
The session aims at providing a general picture of Japan’s ODA programs in water sector and also its possible future policies or models.  Firstly overviews on ODA programs of Japan’s government for water supply and sanitation will be given with some case studies.  Thereafter current and future worldwide issues related to water supply &amp; sanitation will be introduced.  The presentation will be followed by and wrapped up with a short debate about some topics provided in the presentation.<br />
<br />
5.	RAILWAY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (by M. Yokota)<br />
In 2010, there were 962 cities which have a population of over a half million. The number of these cities will be increased to be 1,418 in 2025. According to the population concentrating, urban infrastructures such as water &amp; sanitation, waste treatment, transport, disaster prevention, medical treatment and public security will be required. Japan&#039;s Government has pronounced to contribute to the infrastructure development with applying an advanced technology, know-how and system, and finding solutions for problems caused by the rapid urbanization. The Japanese railway system is evaluated to secure high punctuality, reliability, safety and user-friendliness. As for railway infrastructure development, an urban railway system and high-speed railway system have been developed based on the Japanese railway system&#039;s superiority. Recently, a railway infrastructure development according to an urban mature stage, urban development along a railway infrastructure and introduction of IC-card to increase in the level of convenience in ticketing have been implemented. However, the Japanese railway technology, know-how and system are not always introduced in Japan&#039;s ODA program due to a lack of price competitive power, marketing/branding methods based on the advanced technology and set-up to provide a railway operation and maintenance.<br />
The session will provide an urban infrastructure development approach collaborating with a Japanese railway operator and municipality which have an experience to operate and maintain a railway and to implement an urban infrastructure development. The will also be group work about a railway infrastructure development based on the presentation.</p>
