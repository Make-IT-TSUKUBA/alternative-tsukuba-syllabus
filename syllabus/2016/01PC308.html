    <p id="posttopics">Course Policy<br />
<br />
1.	Class Sessions: Class sessions will include a review of study materials. To get the most from the class sessions, it is important that you come to class prepared. At a minimum, you should overview the assigned chapter in the textbook. For all class sessions, I will make the lecture notes available. However, they are not intended to be a substitute for the readings in the textbook. <br />
<br />
2.	Class Participation: You will be rewarded by your participation in class discussions. Class participation means active participation and qualitatively, not quantitatively, positive contribution during class. The class participations (10% of final performance evaluation) can be in the form of followings, but not limited to: answering questions (no need of “right answers”) as asked by instructor, raising questions regarding the discussed topics, and any other suggestion or correction contributing to class/case discussions as well as to tutorials. The factors that certainly have a negative impact on your class participation points include the followings: interrupting class discussion by arriving late or leaving early, reading or doing other work in class, distracting other students, not bringing proper class materials (textbook or lecture notes), and missing classes without previous permissions by instructor. Class participation is a continuous assessment throughout the term. You should be reminded that you have to earn your class participation mark to pass the course.<br />
<br />
3.	Group Project: You can form a group by yourselves. It is required for each group to hand in a group project report for the case analysis of “Seligram, Inc.: Electronic Testing Operations” using the PowerPoint. I will evaluate only the group project report. The group project will be 40% of final performance evaluation. You group needs to submit the group project report by February 1 via email (email address: yooyk@korea.ac.kr). Late submission will not be entertained. The details of the group project are as follows.  <br />
<br />
a. Format <br />
<br />
The final group project report must include a cover page, listing the following information: project title, instructor’s name, group number and group members’ names. The details of the analyses, if any, must be appended. <br />
<br />
b. Contents <br />
<br />
You are required to answer all four required questions. See the following list of questions. <br />
<br />
1) What caused the existing system at ETO to fail?     <br />
2) Calculate the reported costs of the five components described in Exhibit 6, under<br />
-	The existing system <br />
-	The system proposed by the accounting manager<br />
-	The system proposed by the consultant <br />
3) Which system is preferable? Why?<br />
4) Would you treat the new machine as a separate cost center or as the part of the main test room? Explain. <br />
<br />
4.	Final Exams: Final exam will be a one-hour open-book exam. Exam questions are to test your knowledge in applying the concepts you have learned during the Session 1 to Session 3. Calculators may be used during the examination but only if they are the “non-programmable” types. You must take the exam on January 26. No make-up exams will be given except for medical reasons supported by proper documentation. Further information, such as questions types, will be announced later. <br />
<br />
5.	Plagiarism: The acts of plagiarism, cheating or the other forms of academic dishonesty are serious offences. Penalty for plagiarism may range from failing the individual piece of assessment to failing the course.<br />
<br />
General Tips <br />
<br />
1.	This course will not be an easy-going course. However, I usually compensate your hard efforts with good grades. <br />
<br />
2.	Each session is built on the basis of the knowledge of the previous sessions. If you are in trouble in earlier sessions, you will not be able to understand the later sessions. Moreover, the level of difficulty increases as the course progress. Thus, please do not allow problems to accumulate. It is very important to be serious with your studies right from the beginning.<br />
<br />
3.	If you have trouble in understanding course materials, please take advantage of my office hours by making appointments.  <br />
<br />
4.	I always appreciate your suggestions, comments and even complaints to improve the quality of the class. Constructive suggestions/comments/complaints during my office hours will be rewarded with good class participation points.</p>
