   <h2 id="assessment-heading">Grading</h2>
   <p id="assessment">Classroom participation: 10% <br />
-	You are expected to be prepared and to be a participating member of each class. <br />
-	Even “lectures” will be interactive so being engaged is important to learning.<br />
<br />
Group Leadership Points: 30% <br />
-	You are expected to be prepared and to be a participating member of each class. <br />
-	Students will form groups of 4-5 students grouped with people they know less well. <br />
-	Students will give assessments of participant effectiveness.<br />
-	3 Points - NOT spread evenly.  (To be reported to the instructor at end of each session)<br />
-	Students are encouraged to keep individual learning journals – will share meta learning<br />
<br />
<br />
Group project: 40% - There will be an individual (20%) AND group part (20%) of the grading in each project.<br />
Choosing Team Members – students are encouraged to select class members who they do NOT know very well.  Groups should be 4-5 members.<br />
Individual Section of the Group Project - Students will be 100% responsible for their own assessment in their own personal environment/company.  Each person should choose one leader in their organization (a CEO or your direct line manager) and write a 3-5 page paper with the following sections:<br />
•	Know Thyself:  How well does this leader know themselves?  <br />
•	How Do Others Perceive You:  How well does this leader know how they are perceived versus their reality?  How does this leader get <br />
•	Authentic Leadership:  How well does this leader embody the Kousze/Posner Leaderhip Model?<br />
•	Leading the Organization:  How well does the leader lead his organization?  What are specific examples of leading (success or failure) and how did the organization react?<br />
•	Self-Assessment/ Learning:  What did you learn through studying this leader’s working style?  What specific things will you do as a manager/leader differently in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is required that this chosen leader is interviewed and be able to interact with the student.  If you are unable to interview the leader, then you should choose another leader for study.<br />
<br />
NOTE ON PRIVACY: The leader name should be kept confidential as do all the papers/discussions on this.  Students should not share the leader names when talking in groups as well.<br />
<br />
NOTE:  Students should also submit their interview form.  BUT it should NOT be just the questions above.  Please think through alternative questions in addition/or in replacement to the above questions above.<br />
<br />
Individual Papers need to be uploaded before Day 4 (September 16th)<br />
<br />
Choosing the Group Project Topic – Students should read each others’ papers and then choose one Leadership theme that came across all of the individual sections.  This topic could be one of the themes discussed in class or another theme of your own choosing.	<br />
Group Project should be structured as a well thought out 2-3 page paper with a 4 page PowerPoint Summary that will be presented in class.  This paper and PowerPoint MUST be uploaded for all to review by September 27th.  The early upload is mandatory because the final day grading is based equally on people asking questions as the group presentation.<br />
<br />
Final Day 20% - There is only a very short 10-minute presentation (one team selected team member can explain it all) and a 20-minute discussion for each group.  The PowerPoint presentations will be loaded up before class AND comments by students are expected before AND during the class.  Each group will take turns answering questions about their projects and it will be an interactive discussion that day.<br />
-	Did Students Ask good questions of other groups?  (10%) Good questions highlight potential weaknesses of a group project (missing details, conclusions that are questionable, background information that was not considered) OR ask for clarification of important matters of that group project.<br />
-	Did Students Answer the questions well as a team?  (10%) Did the students know their materials; did the group look and act like a team?  Did the group answer questions well?</p>
